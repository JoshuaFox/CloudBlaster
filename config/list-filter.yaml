# These are the asset types that will be skipped by the Lister.
#
# Full list of asset types is in asset-types.properties.
#
# Development of new asset types: See comment at top of asset-types.properties.
#
# The regex  is a full-string match on the local asset name, for example the Topic or Instance name.
#
# For example:
#
# 1. The lines
#          appengine.googleapis.com/Version:
#            regex: "foo.*"
#            listThese: false
#
#     are used for a blacklist: GAE Versions with names like foo and foobar will be skipped in listing.
#     However, quuxfoo will NOT be skipped as there is no full-string match;
#        for a partial-string match you could use ".*foo.*".
#
# 2. The same thing but with
#            listThese: true
#    is used for a whitelist: that only names foo and foobar and other full-string-matching names will be listed.
#
# 3. To list everything, leave the key's value blank, as in the examples below.
#
# 4. To list nothing in a given service
#          appengine.googleapis.com/Version:
#            regex: "UNSUPPORTED"
#            listThese: true
