# These are the asset types that will be listed.

# The lister will  list  the assets that are matched by the regex.
# (Full-string match on the local name, for example the Topic or Instance name) .
#
# Put the regex in quotes to keep yaml happy.
#
# If the regex is missing, all assets of that type will be listed.
#
# To avoid listing an asset type, use the regex "$a"  which rejects all strings.
