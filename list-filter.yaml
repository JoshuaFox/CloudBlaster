# These are the asset types that will be skipped by the Lister.
#
# The Lister will list only the assets that are NOT matched by the regex:
# I.e., these are the assets that you want to "protect".
# (It is a full-string match on the local asset name, for example the Topic or Instance name.)
#
# For example
# 1. The lines
#          appengine.googleapis.com/Version:
#            regex: "foo.*"
#            listThese: false
#
#     is used for a blacklist: GAE Versions with names like foo and foobar will be skipped in listing.
#     However, quuxfoo will NOT be skipped (as there is no full-string match; for this you could use ".*foo.*").
#
# 2. The same thing but with
#            listThese: true
#    is used for a whitelist: that only names foo and foobar and other full-string-matching names  will be listed.
